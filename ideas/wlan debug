See forum post Any way to view Android screen remotely without root? - Post #9.

Connect the device via USB and make sure debugging is working.
adb tcpip 5555
find the IP address with adb shell netcfg
adb connect <DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS>:5555
Disconnect USB and proceed with wireless debugging.
adb -s <DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS>:5555 usb to switch back when done.
No root required!

To find the IP address of the device: run adb shell and then netcfg.
You'll see it there. To find the IP address while using OSX run the command adb shell ip route.
